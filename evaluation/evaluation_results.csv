What is the difference between applying for leave through VTOP and applying for leave manually?,"So you're asking about leaves on campus! There's a big difference between applying for leave through our student portal, VTOP, and doing it manually.

Applying through VTOP is way easier and more efficient. You can apply at least 48 hours in advance, get approval from your mentor and warden, and even submit an outing request (if that's what you need). Plus, it all gets recorded on our end, so there are no worries about missing anything.

Applying manually requires a lot more legwork - you'll need to find the right people and figure out all the details yourself. And, if something goes wrong or you forget something, you might miss a deadline or get into trouble.

What is the difference between applying for leave through VTOP and applying for leave manually?," Applying for leave through VTOP and applying for leave manually both serve the same purpose but there are some differences between them. Here's how they differ based on the steps you provided:

2. Finding the section: In VTOP, click on the left-side menu and select 'Hostels'. For manual applications, find the appropriate leave application form.

3. Selecting the type of leave: Choose between 'General Outing' or 'Leave' in VTOP. When applying manually, make sure to fill out the correct form based on your purpose (e.g., medical, personal, etc.).

4. Providing details: Fill in the necessary details in both cases. This may include personal information, reasons for leave, and expected duration.

5. Submission: In VTOP, submit your application once you've filled it out. For manual applications, hand over the completed form to the appropriate department or administrator.

What happens if I miss the registration deadline in course registration?," If you miss the registration deadline for your courses, including the Capstone Project, it could lead to some issues. Here's what typically happens:

1. You will not be automatically enrolled in any of your chosen courses for the semester, and this may impact your academic progress.
2. To avoid being dropped from the University rolls, you might need to contact your academic advisor or the registrar's office immediately. They can help you explore options to add courses late if there are spots available.
3. However, if all courses are full or it's too late for late registration, you may have to wait until the next semester to enroll in those courses. This delay could potentially affect your graduation timeline.
4. In case of the Capstone Project, since it can only be registered during the 4th year and has specific requirements like the submission of a proposal format for approval, missing the deadline might require you to speak with both your internal guide (from your School) and external guide (if applicable) about potential extensions or alternative arrangements.
